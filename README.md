## Self Driving Car

_Self-driving cars_ are set to be the next revolution in the automotive industry. 
The idea is simple: **create a vehicle that can see the world and react to it as a human driver would**, 
_but_ the implementation is **fraught with obstacles**. 
You are tasked with creating a program that will allow a car to react to obstacles in the road.

### To accomplish this, you’ll 
* use your knowledge of TypeScript object types to apply types to a variety of classes, properties, and methods. 

> Start your engine and let’s hit the road!


Project file structure:

- **index.ts**: The file we’ll use to write a self-driving car program.
- **computer-vision.ts**: Contains a function that will generate random obstacles for our car to avoid.
- **tsconfig.json**: Defines the rules for TypeScript to compile code into JavaScript.
