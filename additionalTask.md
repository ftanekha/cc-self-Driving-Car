# Take this project to the next level and practice your skills with these extra credit tasks:

1. Write code that will 
 * call .respond() many times with new events to see a sequence of turns,
 * allows the car to accelerate or decelerate based on the event. You could make this another type that extends the Control type.
2. Add more types of events so your car can do things like ‘emergencyBrake’ or ‘parallelPark’.
